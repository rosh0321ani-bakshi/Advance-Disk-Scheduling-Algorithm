# Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

A comprehensive web-based simulator for disk scheduling algorithms with detailed explanations and visualizations.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of disk scheduling algorithms
- Real-time visualization of disk head movement
- Detailed explanations of each algorithm
- Performance metrics and comparisons
- Responsive design for all devices
- Modern black and blue theme

## Algorithms Implemented

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
5. LOOK
6. C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
